"""Download the Allen expression grids the ontology panel asks for, once.

Python route, in run order (tools\\venv_atlas; run_closeup in tools\\venv_flat):
     1. run_per_mouse          per brain: tissue mask, backgrounds

        run_replot             redraws those maps (not in a full run)
     5. run_region_plot        region statistics, no warping
     6. run_region_groups      the same by system and by layer
     7. run_video              cohort videos
     8. run_video_compare      young beside adult, plane by plane
     9. run_closeup            close-ups and flatmaps (venv_flat)
    10. run_diagnostics        sheets that audit each step
    11. run_panel_build        390-gene ontology panel (network, cached)

    13. run_structure_set      A1: the declared structures, the
                               adult profiles; figure 01
    14. run_ish_section_qc     A2: the experiments of both panels
                               and the repair (network, once);
                               section QC; QC sheets
    15. run_ish_gene_table     A9: region means, the gene table,
                               merged profiles, gene sets,
                               documentation; figures 02, 02s
    16. run_ish_spatial_null   A7: surrogate maps and their checks
    17. run_ish_gene_ranking   analysis 1: each gene against the
                               map, the null, autofluorescence (A8),

                               figures 13, 13s
    19. run_ish_divisions      analysis 2 (A6): between or within
                               divisions; figures 09, 09s, gene sheets
    20. run_ish_gene_sets      analysis 3: kinds of genes; localisation
                               against matched controls; figures 10,
                               10s1, 10s2
    21. run_synaptome          the measured synapse density (network,
                               once): PSD95 puncta per structure,
                               its coverage of the fit; figure 14s
    22. run_beyond_density     analysis 4: what Gria1 and synapse
                               density leave; the leftover
    23. run_beyond_controls    seven attempts to break it
    24. run_beyond_calibration the same model on maps whose answer
                               is known
    25. run_beyond_regression  the regression, per structure
    26. run_beyond_figures     figures 03, 03s, 04, 11s1 and 14
    27. run_ish_top_genes      the genes that follow the map most,
                               characterised; Cacng8 and the AMPA
                               receptor complex family against the
                               leftover; figures 07, 08, 11, 11s2,
                               sheets
    28. run_sep_channel_check  analysis 5: what the green channel
                               reports; figures 15, 15s

                               index; the numbers for the text

Fetches only the grids missing from atlas_ish/, so it can be re-run after a
partial run (the method is in sepmap/ish/panel_fetch.py). Needs the network; the
checks skip it, since the grids are cached. Writes, under the data root:
