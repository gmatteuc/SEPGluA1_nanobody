"""Annotation words and GO terms at the top of the gene ranking, tested.

Python route, in run order (tools\\venv_atlas; run_closeup in tools\\venv_flat):

     3. run_cohort             cohort mean, SD and n per voxel
     4. run_compare            young against adult: maps, table
        run_replot             redraws those maps (not in a full run)
     5. run_region_plot        region statistics, no warping

                               documentation; figures 02, 02s
    16. run_ish_spatial_null   A7: surrogate maps and their checks
    17. run_ish_gene_ranking   analysis 1: each gene against the
                               map, the null, autofluorescence (A8),
                               the Cacng8 - Gria1 gap; figures 05,
                               06, 07s and 12, with their s
    18. run_ish_robustness     A3: the ranking under other choices;
                               figures 13, 13s
    19. run_ish_divisions      analysis 2 (A6): between or within
                               divisions; figures 09, 09s, gene sheets
    20. run_ish_gene_sets      analysis 3: kinds of genes; localisation
                               against matched controls; figures 10,
                               10s1, 10s2
    21. run_synaptome          the measured synapse density (network,
                               once): PSD95 puncta per structure,
                               its coverage of the fit; figure 14s1
    22. run_density_markers    the synapse-density genes, chosen by
                               PSD95 without the map (network,
                               once); figure 03s3
    23. run_beyond_density     analysis 4: what Gria1 and synapse
                               density leave; the leftover
    24. run_beyond_controls    seven attempts to break it
    25. run_beyond_calibration the same model on maps whose answer
                               is known; the check rows, each
                               with its own floor
    26. run_beyond_regression  the regression, per structure
    27. run_beyond_figures     figures 03, 03s1, 03s2, 04, 11s1, 14
    28. run_ish_top_genes      the genes that follow the map most,
                               characterised; Cacng8 and the AMPA
                               receptor complex family against the
                               leftover; figures 07, 08, 11, 11s2,
                               sheets
    29. run_sep_channel_check  analysis 5: what the green channel
                               reports; figures 15, 15s
    30. run_ish_overview       figures 00, 16 and 16s, the figure
                               index; the numbers for the text

Not in the run order: it writes adult_v2/ish/, the frozen run of 5 October, so a
rerun would overwrite it; run_ish_gene_sets.py (step 20) replaces it, and it moves
to archive/ with the next step of the refactor.

Fetches each gene's GO record from mygene.info once and tests every GO term and
word against the gene ranking of run_ish_compare; the method is in
sepmap/ish/words.py. Writes, in adult_v2/ish/ under the data root:

    annotation/<symbol>.json     the cached mygene.info record of each gene
    feature_enrichment.csv       every feature, every reading
    ish_word_enrichment.png      the top features and the contrast named in
                                 advance, for zref
